VOID SENTINEL // Predictive Bullet Hell

OVERVIEW Void Sentinel is a high-intensity, web-based bullet hell boss fight. Built using pure JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, the game challenges players to survive against an entity that utilizes predictive algorithms to track and eliminate the target.

CORE MECHANICS Predictive AI: The Sentinel Core analyzes your movement vectors and fires shots where you are projected to be, rather than your current position. Adaptive Aggression: The boss's fire rate and pattern complexity increase as its health diminishes. Neon-Void Aesthetic: A minimalist, high-contrast visual style with dynamic screen shake and particle effects.

CONTROLS Movement: Use the mouse to control the pilot's position. Combat: Hold the Left Mouse Button to engage the Sentinel Core. Hitbox: Your vulnerability is limited to the small white core in the center of your pilot craft.

TECHNICAL DETAILS The project is contained within a single HTML file, making it highly portable and lightweight. It features:

Custom particle system for explosions and impacts.

Radial and linear gradient rendering for glow effects.

Velocity-based calculation for AI targeting.
